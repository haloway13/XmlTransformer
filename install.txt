- Linux: Copy ~/.config/sublime-text/Packages/XmlTransformer/setup_XmlTransformer_ubuntu.sh to ~, then run `chmod +x ~/setup_XmlTransformer_ubuntu.sh; ~/setup_XmlTransformer_ubuntu.sh`.
- Windows: Copy ~/.config/sublime-text/Packages/XmlTransformer/setup_XmlTransformer_windows.bat to a folder and double-click to run.
